Forecasting by Smoothing Techniques
===================================

Data collected over time is likely to show some form of random variation.
"Smoothing techniques" can be used to reduce or cancel the effect of these
variations. These techniques, when properly applied, will ``smooth`` out the
random variation in the time series data to reveal any underlying trends that
may exist.
